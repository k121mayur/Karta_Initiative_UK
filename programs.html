                <p class="txt-clr-2">The Karta Initiative offers a range of transformative programs designed to bridge
                    gaps in education,
                    skill development, and employment for young people in the Global South. These programs focus on
                    equipping youth with the tools, resources, and support they need to succeed in higher education,
                    meaningful employment, and entrepreneurship. At the heart of Karta’s work lies the belief that
                    empowering marginalized youth with 21st-century skills, mentorship, and opportunities is the key to
                    breaking cycles of poverty and marginalization.
