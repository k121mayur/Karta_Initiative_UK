                </h4>

                <p class="txt-clr-2">We are thrilled to announce our partnership with The Vidya Trust, a collaboration
                    aimed at creating transformative opportunities for rural youth in India. With their generous
                    support, Karta Initiative is implementing a 21st-Century Skill-Building Program at Jawahar Navodaya
                    Vidyalaya (JNV) Palghar, Maharashtra. This program is reaching 100 students aged 14–18, equipping
                    them with essential skills to succeed in higher education and beyond.

                </p>
                <p> Through this initiative, students are gaining critical skills such as digital literacy,
                    problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. They are also receiving structured career guidance and
                    mentorship to help them navigate the transition from school to university and ultimately, meaningful
                    employment. By focusing on practical, real-world applications, the program prepares students to
                    thrive in a competitive global landscape.
                </p>
                <p>This partnership with The Vidya Trust is a significant step forward in our mission to empower
                    marginalized youth and provide equal opportunities for all. Together, we aim to break the
                    intergenerational cycle of marginalization, enabling these students to transform their lives and
                    become change leaders in their communities. We are proud of the impact this collaboration is
                    creating and look forward to expanding our work to reach even more young people in need.</p>
